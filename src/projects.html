                    <p>The goal of this project was to test the effects of subband 
                        image compression on a test image. Different quatization 
                        levels and wavelets can be specified.

                        PiSense is an IoT security solution that aims to accurately 
                        identify potential threats through object detection. Current 
                        "smart" security systems only contain simple motion detection
                         systems that cannot differentiate a Human from a SUV. Instead 
                         PiSense utilizes object detection through Neural Networks to 
                         identify humans. Now rather than getting flooded with notification 
                         from an motion, the user will now only get notified if a Human's 
                         presence is detected. PiSense can also identify whether the subject
                         is known or a potential intruder through facial recognition.

                        The site will be a place for users to learn about and play the game 
                        Sudoku. The hope is that it will be enjoyed by users at a variety of 
                        skill levels by offering a tutorial and multiple difficulties. this
                        website was designed as my final project in my graduate Web Programming
                        course.

                        Creating various Species Distribution Models using different correlative
                        methods in R. Following a SDM tutorial linked in my repo I was able to build
                        SDMs using the following methods: Profile, Classical Linear Regression, and
                        Machine Learning.
